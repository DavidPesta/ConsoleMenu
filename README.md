## About

By adding the files in lib to a new project, you can put together a very quick and effective console menu system with menu items that are tied to actions.

The files that exist outside of the lib folder are a super clumsy example of the simple and powerful ways to put the menu together.

To add color and flair to your console menu, definitely add one of these to your project:
